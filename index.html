                <p><strong>By Adam Toubes</strong> | Published on: <em>December 8, 2024</em></p>
                <p>During the start of the pandemic, fentanyl claimed more lives in San Francisco than the  <a href= https://www.sf.gov/data/covid-19-cases-and-deaths>coronavirus</a>. The Fentanyl epidemic has been on a decline in recent years, but the trail it has left is something unforgettable.</p>
                <p>Since its introduction seven years ago, fentanyl has been one of the city's most pressing topics; the pandemic has changed nothing. Its impact has devastated San Francisco, reaching an all-time high of 724 overdose deaths in 2020. Despite a slight decline over the last four years, the effects on specific neighborhoods have been devastating. </p>

                <p>To put it in perspective, five years ago, San Francisco's overdose rate was in line with the national average. But since then, the city's death toll has almost doubled the pace of the national overdose toll. That rapid increase was driven by the 867 people who died in the first two years of the pandemic. In the almost five years prior, there were <a href="https://www.sfdph.org/dph/files/newsMediadocs/2020PR/PressReleaseSFOverdoseDataJan-Jun2019-02182020.pdf"> 506 fentanyl overdoses in total</a>.The graph shows the sharp rise in overdose deaths in San Francisco compared to the national average in 2020-2021, according to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/31/upshot/san-francisco-drug-crisis.html">New York Times</a> </p>

                <p> This drug is nothing to play around with. Fentanyl, a human-made opioid, is 50-100 times stronger than morphine. Even the smallest amount of this drug can have harmful effects, including the speeding up of breathing and eventual loss of oxygen. Fentanyl is a drug that can become addictive, but there are treatments. However, this chameleon-like drug has hit some neighborhoods harder than others. </p>

                <p>From research and use of the data, I identified a commonality between the communities with the highest overdose rates: a high rate of poverty. As shown in the figure below, this factor directly correlates to San Francisco, as neighborhoods like Tenderloin, South of Market, and Mission combined to have almost the same number of overdose deaths as the other 88 neighborhoods. According to the heat map, the areas where these neighborhoods are located have the highest poverty rate in San Francisco. </p>

            <p> An example of this is in neighborhoods like Tenderloin, where treatments are not readily available or easily accessible to the people there due to the <a href="https://filtermag.org/san-francisco-safe-consumption-sites/"> low level of funding</a> for anti-drug rograms. In an interview with University of California, San Francisco, Professor Dr. Daniel Ciccarone discussed how Tenderloin and other poor areas have been hotspots for overdose deaths for a while, and during COVID-19, that spike was influenced mainly by these areas.</p>

                <div class="wrapper">
            <p>Dr. Ciccarone, who primarily focuses on heroin use, explained that these communities initially preferred heroin. But over the last ten years, he has conducted street research and discovered that as fentanyl was introduced to the country and made its way to San Francisco, it became inevitable that these communities would eventually start using it. He says, from his observations, that with the introduction of fentanyl, people are dying at a faster rate. Overdose deaths by people using way before the massive spike at the start of the pandemic can be rooted back to cities not being able to afford readily available treatments.  </p>

            <p>The pandemic accelerated the crisis and disproportionately affected those in economically disadvantaged areas. Dr. Ciccarone uses one overarching theme to describe the COVID-fentanyl crisis: social isolation.</p>

            <p>He says, "Social isolation makes people feel bad. And if you're a drug consumer, a big part of the reason you're using, you know, again, this is a stereotype or generalization, is for you to control your symptoms, control whether it's physical symptoms or your mental health symptoms."</p>

            <p>With nobody able to leave during the COVID years, people were all alone with their thoughts and physical and mental pain. As Dr. Ciccarone said, people who use drugs often turn to opioids as a way to relieve that pain. </p>

            <p>But a big reason why there were so many overdoses in 2020 and 2021 was that people would not use Narcan. Naloxone, more commonly known as Narcan, reverses the effects of an opioid overdose and can help someone who has opioids in their system start breathing normally again. But even before, Narcan was hardily available in areas that needed it the most, and it was and is still costly (typically just under $50) </p>

            <p>The problem during COVID, according to Dr. Ciccarone, was that Narcan had to be administered by another person. During the pandemic, most people were home alone taking these drugs and ultimately died from them. </p>


            <p>In 2024, overdose deaths have decreased significantly. Dr. Ciccarone attributes the decrease in deaths to the theory that, as we move farther away from social isolation and the world goes back to normal, so does the rate and number of overdose deaths. Compared to the first nine months of 2023, overdose deaths have dropped by <a href="https://www.sf.gov/news/san-francisco-has-continued-decline-fatal-overdoses-expands-demand-treatment-program-people"> 20% </a> in 2024. People can interact with one another and administer Narcan. </p>

            <p>Mayor Dean Preston and Mayor-elect Daniel Lurie have a solution in economically disadvantaged areas like Tenderloin, Mission, and South of Market. Preston released a report that replicates an overdose prevention plan from sister city Zurich, Switzerland. </p>

            <p>The plan aims to create safe spaces for people to administer drugs and provide readily available sites for medical care and harm reduction. After reading about this plan, San Francisco understands this crisis is too big to tackle alone. By creating this plan, the city hopes to chip away at it for a better and safer future. </p>
